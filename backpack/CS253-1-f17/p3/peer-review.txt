Peer: Devan Karsann

1)
In addition to prior functions of the smash.c shell we added a history command that prints to konsole the history 
of commands entered by user. 

2)
The goal is to add more functionality to the smash.c shell. It also increases the scope of functions in which
smash.c can use, by adding a new file history.c which requires a new header file named history.h.

3) 
Readability:
Comments on every condition check in every file. Very easy to read, due to proper indentation. 

Structure:
Everything is indented properly and is very clean/easy to read.

Testing:
Used valgrind. Testing consisted of print statements and running smash. 

Readability = 2

Structure = 2

Testing = 2



Reflection on own score: My peer graded very fairly, maybe even too fairly. I plan on
fixing indentations and making sure that all memory locations are freed properly. Aside from that
I agree with the other scores and will be using his advice to better my program and future programs.
