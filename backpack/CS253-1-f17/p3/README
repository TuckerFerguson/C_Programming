CS253 Section 1

Overview:
This program is a basic shell. It is a foothold in an overall functionable shell script which we will be 
developing later but it still contains working functions that one would typically expect. Such as the ability
to change directories, exit and to accept other command line arguments. 

Compiling and Using:
This code is ran simply by using the command ./smash in the directory containing all source files. Afterwards
it will generate a very basic shell which takes in several different system calls. To exit one simply types
"exit" as covered in the write up. 

Testing:
I tested this code several times by simply watching output in the konesole and making sure it matched what was
expected in the orginial write up. Next I took advantage of the test files and made sure my program passed 
all provided resources. Finally I made use of valgrind to check for memory leaks.

Sources Used:
I took advantage of the resources included in the project write up, help from my class
tutors, lab tutors, my instructor and zybooks. 

Known Issues:
N/A (hopefully)
