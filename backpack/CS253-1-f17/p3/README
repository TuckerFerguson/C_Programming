Shell Part 2 & Shell Part 3

Overview:
This program is a basic shell. It is a foothold in an overall functionable shell script which we will be 
developing later but it still contains working functions that one would typically expect. Such as the ability
to change directories, exit and to accept other command line arguments. In addition it now contains the a new 
command that prints the history to konesole. 

Compiling and Using:
This code is ran simply by using the command ./smash in the directory containing all source files. Afterwards
it will generate a very basic shell which takes in several different system calls. To exit one simply types
"exit" as covered in the write up. In order to print the history the user must enter "history" and a stack of
all commands will be printed to konesole. 

Testing:
for part (1):
I tested this code several times by simply watching output in the konesole and making sure it matched what was
expected in the orginial write up. Next I took advantage of the test files and made sure my program passed 
all provided resources. Finally I made use of valgrind to check for memory leaks.

for part(2):
To ensure that history was working properly I often inserted print statments into methods to ensure that they
were being accessed, this was done in the history.c file. Next after ensuring that every method was being 
accessed I began checking if the proper history was being printed to konesole. The only issue I ever really
struggled with was making sure that the stack was printed properly with corresponding numbers. After a while
I got the history command to print exactly what was listed in the example. 


Sources Used:
I took advantage of the resources included in the project write up, help from my class
tutors, lab tutors, my instructor and zybooks. 

for part 2 I also took advantage of the examples sent out to us via email from Shane. 

Known Issues:
not every memory allocated was freed, although there was no leaks.
