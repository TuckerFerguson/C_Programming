See \hyperlink{CONTENTS_8md}{C\-O\-N\-T\-E\-N\-T\-S.\-md} for a description of the p1 starter files supplied to you in this folder. You should complete the template below with your own words to finish this R\-E\-A\-D\-M\-E file.

\subsection*{Overview}

Concisely explain what the program does. If this exceeds a couple of sentences, you're going too far. Generally you should be pulling this right from the project specification. We don't want you to just cut and paste, but paraphrase what is stated in the project specification.

\subsection*{Manifest}

A listing of source files and other non-\/generated files and a brief (one line) explanation of the purpose of each file.

\subsection*{Building the project}

This section should tell the user how to build your code. If you are delivering a library, where does it need to be installed or how do you use it? Is this an executable, if so how can a user get up to speed as fast as possible.

\subsection*{Features and usage}

Summarize the main features of your program. It is also appropriate to instruct the user how to use your program.

\subsection*{Testing}

This section should detail how you tested your code. Simply stating \char`\"{}\-I ran
it a few times and it seems to work\char`\"{} is not sufficient. Your testing needs to be detailed here or even better, this section should document the appropriate smoke/unit/system tests that you wrote.

\subsubsection*{Valgrind}

Describe how you tested your project with Valgrind the current status of your bill of health from Valgrind!

\subsubsection*{Known Bugs}

List known bugs that you weren't able to fix (or ran out of time to fix).

\subsection*{Reflection and Self Assessment}

Discuss the issues you encountered during development and testing. What problems did you have? What did you have to research and learn on your own? What kinds of errors did you get? How did you fix them?

What parts of the project did you find challenging? Is there anything that finally \char`\"{}clicked\char`\"{} for you in the process of working on this project? How well did the development and testing process go for you?

\subsection*{Sources used}

If you used any sources outside of the lecture notes, class lab files, or text book you should list them here. If you looked something up on stackoverflow.\-com and fail to cite it in this section it will be considered plagiarism and be dealt with accordingly.
