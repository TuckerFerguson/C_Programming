## Overview

This is my own memory management implemenntation specifically regarding malloc/free.

## Manifest

INCLUDED FILES:

~/TuckerFerguson@u.boisestate.edu/backpack/CS453-2-f18/p6


## Building the project

All project files should be in the same directory.

From the directory containing the .c source code, make the project:
    $ make


## Features and usage

User implementation of malloc and free, based upon Buddy system

The ability for interposing malloc, and itegrating it with my own shell (mydash) and other programs


## Testing

Part of the project write up specifies a testsuite, this being said all tests I created will be located in there.
As well as a few instructor provided tests.

### Known Bugs

Several at this moment


## Reflection and Self Assessment

This assignment really sparked my interest and I wish I had not only more time to work on it but complete solitude to focus
on it as well. Other (less important in my opinion) courses conflicted with my ability to work on this alone. However the concepts
covered in this project were covered heavily in lecture allowing me to have a much better understanding of how memory truly works.

## Sources used

Instructor provided code, the C standard library (wikipedia),
Past Projects, Stackoverflow.com, github for referencing syntax.
